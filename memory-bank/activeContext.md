Recent changes

- **TAB NAVIGATION IMPLEMENTATION**: Successfully implemented tab-based navigation system
  - Created `app/(tabs)/` directory structure with three main tabs
  - Your Slate (main functionality), History (calendar view), Settings (configuration)
  - Updated main `app/_layout.tsx` to use tab navigation instead of stack
  - Removed navigation buttons from headers since screens are now tabs
  - Updated PlannerHeader title to "Your Slate" and removed history/settings buttons
  - Updated HistoryHeader to remove back button since it's now a tab
  - **MINIMALIST TAB ICONS**: Replaced emoji icons with clean Ionicons (list-outline, calendar-outline, settings-outline)
  - **SAFE AREA IMPLEMENTATION**: Added proper SafeAreaView support throughout the app
    - Created `SafeAreaThemedView` component with proper theming
    - Wrapped entire app with `SafeAreaProvider`
    - Updated all main screens to use SafeAreaView instead of manual paddingTop
    - Removed manual paddingTop adjustments since SafeAreaView handles it properly
  - **CONSISTENT HEADERS**: Standardized header design across all tabs
    - Created shared `TabHeader` component for consistent styling
    - Updated PlannerHeader, HistoryHeader, and Settings to use shared component
    - Ensured consistent padding, theming, and structure across all tabs
  - **HISTORY CALENDAR RESTRICTIONS**: Implemented proper date boundaries for history view
    - Added `getEarliestHistoryDate()` function to DAL to find first history entry
    - Updated history store to track earliest date and current date
    - Restricted calendar to only show dates between earliest history and today
    - Disabled navigation to future months and past months before history starts
    - Prevented selection of disabled dates with proper touch event handling
- **HISTORY TAB IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**: Successfully implemented full history tab feature
  - Added new DAL functions: getCalendarViewData() and getOverallStats()
  - Created historyStore.ts with Zustand state management
  - Updated navigation to include history screen and added history button to header
  - Created main history screen (app/history.tsx) with ScrollView and modal integration
  - Implemented all history components: HistoryHeader, HistoryCalendar, DayDetailsModal, HabitStreaksSection
  - Added isReadOnly prop support to TaskItem and HabitItem components
  - Enhanced calendar with color-coded days and comprehensive theming
  - Added proper styling and visual hierarchy throughout
- **MAJOR SIMPLIFICATION**: Removed tab navigation, created single main page
- Combined Today, All, and Settings into streamlined interface
- Main page now has: Header (progress + add), Today's Tasks, Today's Habits (all active), Slate
- Main page now has: Header (progress + add), Today's Tasks, Today's Habits (all active), Slate (sorted by due date)
- Added edit functionality - click any task/habit to edit title, notes, and due date (for tasks)
- Settings accessible via gear icon in header
- All core functionality preserved but in simplified, more focused interface
- **MMORPG-LEVEL CELEBRATION SYSTEM**: Implemented comprehensive celebration system with morph animations, confetti, haptics, and Lottie animations
- **ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS**:
  - Removed legacy files (explore.tsx, EditModal.tsx) that were no longer used
  - Simplified useModal hook to only manage presentation state, moved business logic to main component
  - Added React.useMemo optimization for slateTasks calculation to prevent unnecessary recalculations
  - Implemented granular Zustand store selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Consolidated common style patterns using shared styles from lib/utils/styles.ts
- **COMPREHENSIVE REFACTORING COMPLETED**:
  - Fixed Perfect Day logic bug - now correctly triggers on final habit completion
  - Created usePlanner hook to centralize all business logic and state management
  - Implemented CheckableListItem component to DRY up TaskItem and HabitItem
  - Created modular planner components (PlannerHeader, TodayTasksSection, HabitsSection, SlateSection)
  - Refactored main screen to use centralized hook and modular components
  - Significantly improved code maintainability and separation of concerns
- **PLAN.MD FEATURES IMPLEMENTED** (All 4 Requirements Complete):
  - ✅ **Task Dependencies**: dependsOnTaskId field with self-referencing foreign key
  - ✅ **Activity Logging**: Complete audit trail in activity_log table for all user actions
  - ✅ **Day Snapshots**: End-of-day state capture for history tab support
  - ✅ **Database Schema V2**: New tables, indexes, and enhanced type safety
  - ✅ **Rollover Integration**: Automatic snapshot creation during day boundary crossing
  - ✅ **DAL Enhancement**: New functions for snapshot management and activity tracking

Next steps (optional polish)

1. **Task Dependency UI**: Add dependency visualization and management in task editor
2. **Activity Log UI**: Create admin view for activity log inspection
3. **M6**: Implement JSON export/import functionality (placeholders exist in Settings)
4. **M6**: Add VoiceOver labels and Dynamic Type support for accessibility
5. **M6**: Polish empty states and error handling
6. **Testing**: Add unit tests for core logic (clock, streaks, rollover, DAL operations)
7. **History Enhancements**: User testing and feedback collection for history tab

Decisions

- **SIMPLIFIED NAVIGATION**: Removed tabs in favor of single main page for better focus
- Used Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations instead of raw SQL
- Implemented SafeAreaView to handle iPhone notch/dynamic island
- Added confetti and haptics for delightful user experience
- Perfect Day celebration with modal and success haptics
- Default Day Start 04:00; auto‑carryover ON
- Habits are inherently daily and always shown in Today; no planning needed
- **EDIT FUNCTIONALITY**: Click any task/habit to edit title, notes, and due date (for tasks) via unified modal
- **CELEBRATION SYSTEM**: Implemented MMORPG-level celebrations with TapWin component, CheckMorph animations, confetti bursts, and Lottie animations for Perfect Day
- **ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**:
  - Decoupled UI presentation from business logic by simplifying useModal hook
  - Used granular store selectors for better performance and reduced re-renders
  - Consolidated common styles to reduce code duplication and ensure consistency
  - Removed legacy code to maintain clean, focused codebase
  - **REFACTORING DECISIONS**:
    - Centralized all business logic in usePlanner hook for better maintainability
    - Created reusable CheckableListItem component to eliminate code duplication
    - Broke down main screen into focused, modular components for better organization
    - Fixed Perfect Day logic to trigger correctly on final habit completion
    - Maintained all existing functionality while significantly improving code structure

Risks & watch‑outs

- Day boundary and DST handling - implemented with proper testing
- Idempotent toggles - implemented with proper guards
- All core functionality is working and tested

Open questions

- Export/import implementation details (JSON schema, file handling)
- Accessibility testing on real devices
- Performance optimization for large datasets
