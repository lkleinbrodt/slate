Active Context

Current focus

- **PLAN.MD REFACTORING COMPLETE** - Successfully implemented all 7 phases with new architecture
- **NEW DATABASE SCHEMA** - Immutable history tables with proper data integrity
- **REPOSITORY PATTERN** - Clean separation between data access and business logic
- **FOUR-TAB NAVIGATION** - Today, Slate, History, and Settings tabs with improved UX
- **UNIFIED STORAGE** - expo-sqlite/kv-store for both relational and key-value data

Recent changes

- **COMPLETE ARCHITECTURAL REFACTORING**: Successfully implemented all 7 phases of plan.md

  - **Phase 0**: Cleaned up obsolete files (DAL, old stores, hooks) and removed MMKV dependency
  - **Phase 1**: Created new database schema with immutable history tables and repository pattern
  - **Phase 2**: Implemented core logic (date utilities, rollover engine, streak calculations)
  - **Phase 3**: Refactored state management to use new repository
  - **Phase 4**: Updated UI and routing with new four-tab structure
  - **Phase 5**: Refactored components to work with new data structures
  - **Phase 6**: Updated history screen to use immutable history tables
  - **Phase 7**: Fixed all linting errors and completed final polish

- **NEW DATABASE ARCHITECTURE**:

  - **Immutable History Tables**: `habit_history` and `task_history` for complete audit trail
  - **Status-Based Tasks**: Tasks now use `status` field instead of `is_done`
  - **Active Habits**: Habits use `is_active` field instead of `active`
  - **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation with `lib/logic/repo.ts` as single data interface
  - **expo-sqlite/kv-store**: Replaced MMKV with built-in key-value storage (no additional dependencies)

- **ENHANCED ROLLOVER LOGIC**:

  - **Robust Day Boundary Handling**: Uses expo-sqlite/kv-store for last processed date tracking
  - **Immutable History Creation**: `finalizeDay()` creates permanent records for each day
  - **Automatic Task Carryover**: Unfinished tasks automatically move to next day
  - **Perfect Day Detection**: Calculated from immutable history data

- **NEW NAVIGATION STRUCTURE**:

  - **Today Tab**: Primary screen for daily task and habit management
  - **Slate Tab**: Focused on unscheduled task management and planning
  - **History Tab**: Calendar view with day details using immutable data
  - **Settings Tab**: Configuration and preferences
  - **Dynamic Routes**: `app/(tabs)/history/[date].tsx` for day details

- **IMPROVED STATE MANAGEMENT**:

  - **New App Store**: `lib/stores/appStore.ts` centralizes Today and Slate functionality
  - **Simplified Settings Store**: Uses repository pattern for cleaner code
  - **History Store**: Manages calendar data and statistics with immutable history
  - **Repository Integration**: All stores now use the new repository layer

- **COMPONENT UPDATES**:

  - **TaskItem**: Updated to use `task.status === "done"` for completion state
  - **HabitItem**: Compatible with new data structure
  - **HabitStreaksSection**: Now uses history store with habit titles and streaks
  - **History Components**: Updated to use immutable history data
  - **Planner Components**: Modular components (PlannerHeader, TodayTasksSection, HabitsSection, SlateSection)

- **STORAGE OPTIMIZATION**:
  - **Removed MMKV**: Replaced with expo-sqlite/kv-store for consistency
  - **Single Storage Solution**: All data now uses SQLite (relational + key-value)
  - **Reduced Dependencies**: One less package to manage and maintain

Next steps (optional polish)

1. **Modal Integration**: Re-implement UnifiedAddModal with new stores (component exists but needs integration)
2. **Task Dependency UI**: Add dependency visualization in task editor
3. **Activity Log UI**: Create admin view for activity log inspection
4. **M6**: Implement JSON export/import functionality (placeholders exist)
5. **M6**: Add VoiceOver labels and Dynamic Type support for accessibility
6. **Testing**: Add unit tests for core logic (rollover, streaks, repository)
7. **Performance**: Optimize for large datasets and add list virtualization

Decisions

- **ARCHITECTURE**: Repository pattern provides clean separation of concerns
- **STORAGE**: expo-sqlite/kv-store eliminates need for additional dependencies
- **NAVIGATION**: Four-tab structure provides better user experience and clarity
- **DATA INTEGRITY**: Immutable history tables ensure complete audit trail
- **TYPE SAFETY**: Drizzle ORM provides full TypeScript integration
- **ROLLOVER**: Robust day boundary handling with automatic task carryover
- **HISTORY**: Immutable data enables reliable historical analysis
- **COMPONENTS**: Modular planner components for better maintainability

Risks & watchâ€‘outs

- **Database Migration**: New schema requires fresh database (old data not migrated)
- **Modal Integration**: UnifiedAddModal exists but needs re-implementation with new stores
- **Component Compatibility**: Some components may need updates for new data structures
- **Testing**: New architecture needs comprehensive testing

Open questions

- **Data Migration**: How to handle existing user data during schema transition
- **Modal Integration**: Best approach for re-implementing UnifiedAddModal with new stores
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies for large datasets
- **Accessibility**: Implementation timeline for VoiceOver and Dynamic Type support
